# Hackathon notes — shared decisions

The one place five parallel tracks talk to each other. Append, do not rewrite.
Newest entry at the bottom of its section.

**How to use this file**

- Anything another track needs to know goes here, not in a commit message.
- Format: `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <track> — <one line>` then the detail.
- If you are **blocked**, add a row to "Open blockers" and name the track that
  unblocks you.
- If you **answered an UNVERIFIED question**, put the answer under "Resolved
  unknowns" with how you verified it. Nine agents must not each rediscover it.
- Merge conflicts on this file are expected and always resolved by keeping
  both sides.

## Open blockers

| Raised by | Blocked on | What I need | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B2, B3, B4 | B1 | `bp_core` with working `replay` mode | open |
| B3 (Task 4) | B2 | `fixtures/labelled/mentions.jsonl` sample | open |
| B5 (Tasks 4, 6, 7) | B2, B3, B4 | agents that run | open |

## Resolved unknowns

Each entry: the question, the answer, and how it was verified. An unverified
answer stays in "Open questions".

### 2026-09-20 — main — Anakin Wire does not carry four of the brief's sources

X/Twitter, Instagram, Google Play reviews and Apple App Store reviews are not in
Anakin's Wire catalogue. Verified by direct 404 on `anakin.io/catalog/<slug>`
for each, corroborated by Anakin's own blog post dated 2026-07-24. Flipkart has
product actions but no reviews action.

Replacements and drops are in [docs/SOURCE-STRATEGY.md](docs/SOURCE-STRATEGY.md).
The `Source` enum is unchanged, so this is a config change, not a schema change.

### 2026-09-20 — main — Anakin Search API returns a snippet, not full page content

The brief says "full page content". It returns `snippet`. Bodies require
chaining Search → URL Scraper at 3 + N credits. Budget accordingly.
Detail in [docs/research/anakin.md](docs/research/anakin.md) §2.

### 2026-09-20 — main — Nasiko AgentCard `protocolVersion` must be `"1.0"`

The `currency-agent` example ships `"0.2.9"`. A real cluster rejects that with
`-32009 VersionNotSupported`. Every BrandPulse card uses `"1.0"`.

### 2026-09-20 — main — the example Dockerfile does not build

`agents/currency-agent/Dockerfile` does `COPY pyproject.toml .` and no such file
exists anywhere in the Nasiko repo. Use ours from
[docs/research/nasiko.md](docs/research/nasiko.md) §4, which builds with the
repo root as context so `shared/` is available.

### 2026-09-20 — main — the Nasiko LLM router discards the request's `model` field

Per-agent model selection is configured with `nasiko llm-config`, not passed in
code. `BP_MODEL_SMALL` therefore does nothing once deployed. B5 owns this.
Detail in [docs/research/nasiko.md](docs/research/nasiko.md) §6 Finding A.

### 2026-09-20 — main — no verified embeddings endpoint on the Nasiko router

The catalogue lists chat models only. bp-clusterer therefore defaults to local
TF-IDF, behind `BP_VECTORISER=tfidf|embeddings`. Detail in §6 Finding B.

## Open questions

The things nobody has verified yet. Claim one by putting your track in the
"owner" column, and move it to "Resolved unknowns" when you have an answer.

| # | Question | Owner | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Which `a2a-sdk` 1.1.0 helper emits a **JSON** artifact? The example only shows text. | B5, Task 1 | All nine agents need it. Lands as `bp_core.a2a.emit_json_artifact`. |
| 2 | How is a peer agent addressed through the Nasiko proxy? The env var name is unverified. | B5, Task 1 | Lands as `bp_core.a2a.call_agent`. No agent writes a peer URL directly. |
| 3 | The literal field names in Wire responses per action. | B2, Task 1 | A guessed field name is an empty dashboard on stage. |
| 4 | Does the Play Store listing yield review text, rating and date through URL Scraper with `useBrowser: true`? | B2, Task 2 | Decides six sources or seven. |
| 5 | Does DronaHQ's WhatsApp trigger send outbound, or do we need the Twilio connector? | B5, Task 7 | The 9am brief depends on it. Meta's 24-hour window may force a template. |
| 6 | Does DronaHQ's Charts control expose the Plotly `hole` config for a donut? | B5, Task 6 | Cosmetic. Ship a pie if not. |

## Decisions log

Things we chose, with the reason, so nobody relitigates them at 3am.

### 2026-09-20 — main — contracts frozen before any worktree branched

`docs/CONTRACTS.md`, `shared/bp_core/models.py` and `db/migrations/001_init.sql`
are frozen on `main`. A field rename is a breaking change for DronaHQ bindings
and every downstream agent. Changes go through B1 on `main`, never inside a
worktree.

### 2026-09-20 — main — we do not use the `anakin-sdk` package

It is alpha. We call the REST API with `httpx` from one file,
`shared/bp_core/anakin.py`, so a wrong assumption about Anakin's shape is a
one-file fix. Reasoning in [docs/research/anakin.md](docs/research/anakin.md) §7.

### 2026-09-20 — main — no source is faked

If a probe fails, that source does not appear in a fixture, a dashboard, a count
or a sentence. Synthetic data exists in exactly one file,
`demo/inject_crisis.py`, and is labelled as an injection in the UI.

## Numbers for the pitch

Filled in as they are measured. **Real output only.** An estimate goes in
brackets and is replaced, never quietly promoted.

| Number | Value | Source | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credits spent recording fixtures | _(est. ~136)_ | B2 Task 7 actual | B2 |
| Mentions in the fixture corpus | — | `fixtures/` count | B2 |
| Sources shipped | _(7, or 6 if Play probe fails)_ | B2 Task 2 | B2 |
| Sentiment accuracy | — | `python -m eval.accuracy` | B3 |
| Intent accuracy | — | `python -m eval.accuracy` | B3 |
| Cost per brand-day, cold | _(target < ₹15)_ | `python -m eval.cost` | B3 |
| Cost per brand-day, warm cache | — | `python -m eval.cost` | B3 |
| Agents deployed on Nasiko | 0 / 9 | `nasiko deploy` | B5 |
| Nasiko PR | — | link | B5 |
